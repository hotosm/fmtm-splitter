Inputs:
- Polygon layer polygonsnocount from previous fmtm-split step
- Polygon layer ways_poly formatted like OSM data from Underpass (tags in jsonb object)

Outputs:
- Polygon layer buildings (OSM buildings with original tags plus the id of the polygon they are found in)
- Polygon layer splitpolygons (the polygons from the previous step, but now with a column with the count of the buildings found within each polygon)
- Polygon layer lowfeaturecountpolygons (All of the polygons with less than a specified number of buildings within them. These are also present in the splitpolygons layer; the idea is to merge them with neighbors, not implemented yet).
