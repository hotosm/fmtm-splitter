/*
Selects every building within a set of OSM polygons that has a tag, any tag,
in addition to 'building'. 

This is a very rough proxy for buildings that have been field mapped. It's 
rough because many buildings have tags other than 'building' that have 
only been remotely mapped. Still, it's useful because most buildings that
have only been digitized in JOSM/ID only have the tag 'building'='yes'.
This filters all of those out.

Works on OSM extracts converted to PostGIS layers using the Underpass 
database schema: 

https://github.com/hotosm/underpass/blob/master/utils/raw.lua

which converts all tags into a jsonb object in a 'tags' column.

Probably useful at some point to  punt tags that don't help 
identify field mapping, such as 'source' (usually just a reference
to the imagery used to digitize)
