Part of the HOT Field Mapping Tasking Manager (FMTM)

Part 01 of FMTM task splitting.

This script splits an Area of Interest into polygons based on OpenStreetMap lines (roads, waterways, and railways). It doesn't take features into account.

It takes three inputs, all PostGIS layers:
1) A polygon layer called project-aoi
2) A line layer formatted like OSM extracts with the Underpass schema (tags in a jsonb object) called ways_line
3) A polygon layer formatted like OSM extracts with the Underpass schema (tags in a jsonb object) called ways_poly

It outputs a single PostGIS polygon layer called polygonsnocount (the "nocount" bit refers to the fact that at this stage we haven't determined if there's anything inside of these polygons; soon we'll count the features to be mapped within them, normally to split further). This layer should be considered a temporary product, but is the input to the next stage of the splitting algorithm.

More information in the adjacent file task_splitting_readme.md.

/*
***************************PARAMETERS FOR ROB************************
- At the moment I split on anything with a highway, waterway, or railway tag of any kind. We'll probably want to allow users to configure which lines they actually use as splitting boundaries.
- At the moment it always uses the AOI polygon itself as a splitline. That should be optional.
